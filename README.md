The decline in the air quality of the Salton Sea has been a crucial concern for the surrounding areas over a period of time. One of the major reasons being shrinking of the sea water level exposes the toxic bottom. The evaporation of water transfers the pollutants to the air. The other major reason is observed to be the blowing wind throughout the Salton Sea basin, thus generating a large amount of dust storms. Also exposing this huge area of salty lakebed could lead to an increase in the amount of blowing dust. This could lead to human health issues and breathing problems. This blowing sand and dust also leads the agricultural occupation to suffer and affects the recreational opportunities throughout the region. The researchers determine that the poor quality of inflow of water and maintaining the diversity of water is a challenging task at the Salton Sea thus the water quality is going to dramatically deteriorate in the coming decades leading to more major problems to water as well as air quality.

With respect to this problem we come up with a project to analyse the air quality of the Salton Sea using machine learning models. We make use of four models namely Decision tree regressor, Random forest regressor, Support Vector Machine and neural network. Further we make use of Ensemble learning approach to gain maximum accuracy from the four models. The air quality analysis is done with respect to pollutants like CO, NO2, O3, PB and PM10. And other parameters like precipitation, wind direction, speed and season. The outcome of the analysis will be the AQI (Air Quality Index), indicating that the effect of the air quality on the basis of the range in which the predicted AQI falls into.
